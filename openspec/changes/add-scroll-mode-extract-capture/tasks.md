## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Identify scroll mode selection sources for PDF, EPUB, markdown, and HTML/RSS items and normalize selection text.

- [x] 1.4 Show a confirmation toast on successful extract creation and surface errors if creation fails.

## 2. Validation
- [ ] 2.1 Manual test: in scroll mode, select text in a PDF and create an extract; confirm the extract saves and a toast appears.
- [ ] 2.2 Manual test: in scroll mode, select text in an EPUB and create an extract; confirm the extract saves and a toast appears.
- [ ] 2.3 Manual test: in scroll mode, select text in a markdown document and create an extract; confirm the extract saves and a toast appears.
- [ ] 2.4 Manual test: in scroll mode, select text in an HTML/RSS document and create an extract; confirm the extract saves and a toast appears.
