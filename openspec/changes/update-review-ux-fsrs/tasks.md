## 1. Discovery and alignment
- [x] 1.1 Audit Review/Queue/Reading surfaces to inventory existing flows and data availability.
- [x] 1.2 Map available FSRS fields and history sources for transparency and simulations.

## 2. Session-aware queue foundation
- [x] 2.1 Implement session blocks with time budgets and safe stop points.
- [x] 2.2 Add zero-friction start flow with optimal session CTA and customization entry.
- [x] 2.3 Add continuous session feedback (items remaining, time remaining, session goal).

## 3. Item card hierarchy and inspector
- [x] 3.1 Implement progressive disclosure cards (level 1/2) for review and reading queues.
- [x] 3.2 Build inspector panel with full FSRS state, history, and scheduling rationale.

## 4. Priority and time estimation
- [x] 4.1 Introduce priority vector UI and weighting presets.
- [x] 4.2 Implement time estimates with confidence bands and variance warnings.
- [x] 4.3 Add session cut-off guarantees with explicit safe stop message.

## 5. FSRS transparency panel
- [x] 5.1 Implement transparency panel with live parameters and plain-language explanations.
- [x] 5.2 Add simulation tools ("What if I answer Hard?", "What if I suspend?").

## 6. Incremental reading integration
- [x] 6.1 Separate reading vs review queues with explicit conversion pathways.
- [x] 6.2 Add UI affordances showing future card impact for reading items.

## 7. Overdue handling and accessibility
- [x] 7.1 Replace overdue styling with neutral drifted state and recovery actions.
- [x] 7.2 Add keyboard-first navigation and power-user toggles (raw metrics, JSON, batch ops).

## 8. Validation and performance
- [x] 8.1 Add unit tests for time estimation and priority weighting.
- [x] 8.2 Add UI tests for session flow, inspector accuracy, and transparency panel.
- [ ] 8.3 Validate performance with large queues and add virtualization if needed.
